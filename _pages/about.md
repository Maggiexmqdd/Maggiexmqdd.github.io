Hi! I'm Manqi, a final-year graduate student in Electric Engineering at Tsinghua University. My research interests are optimization, game theory, control, and their application in power systems. I received my bachelorâ€™s degree with honors in Management Science and Technology at North China Electric Power University. I enjoy hiking, badminton, and traveling in my spare time.
