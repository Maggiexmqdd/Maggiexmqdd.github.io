Hi! I'm Manqi, a final-year graduate student in Electric Engineering at Tsinghua University.

My research interests are optimization, game theory, control, and their application in power systems.

I received my bachelorâ€™s degree with honor in Management Science and Technology at North China Electric Power University.

In my spare time, I enjoy hiking, badminton, traveling, and photography.
